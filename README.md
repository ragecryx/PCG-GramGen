PCG-GramGen
===================

Library that lets you define rules of production and then generate content based on those rules.

### TODO

* [x] Add another End() method that receives and saves a weight for each rule.
* [x] On the generator pass rand() value through a normal distribution to have control over the production rules frequency (rule weight becomes usefull).
* [ ] template<class T> on Generator or a specialized class to be able to generate actual (game) objects
